Welcome to my independent study page! On here, you can find all of my collected research, blog posts, and designs- but first, an introduction.
My name is Lisa Rosov, I am a Senior at Adlai E. Stevenson High School. Did you know that approximately 10,000 people die each year worldwide due to hurricanes and tropical storms?
Yeah, I didn't either. Those who are lucky enough to survive most often lose everything. I want to find a way to help those who have lost their homes
